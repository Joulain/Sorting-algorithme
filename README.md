Here is the list of different sort available : <br/> <br/>
- Bubble sort {O(n²)} : bubble <br/>
- Reverse bubble sort {O(n²)} : rbubble <br/>
- Selection sort {O(n²)} : selection <br/>
- Reverse selection sort {O(n²)} : rselection <br/>
- Merging sort {O(nLogn)} : merge <br/>
- Reverse merging sort {O(nLogn)} : rmerge <br/> <br/>
To quit the program type exitq
